## 🚀 Real-World Software Pipeline Simulation using Python Abstraction
This project simulates a real-world software development pipeline, showcasing how software, data engineering, and ML teams collaborate through structured, versioned, and abstracted codebases.

## 🎯 Objectives
✅ Show how code is structured and divided across teams

✅ Demonstrate how abstraction ensures clean integration and extensibility

✅ Mimic real-world CI/CD pipelines using GitHub workflows

## 👥 Roles & Responsibilities
Role	Responsibility	File
👨‍💼 Senior Developer	Designs abstract skeleton using base classes	Version1.py
👨‍💻 Junior Developer	Inherits and implements core logic	Version2.py
🧪 User/Tester	Executes complete pipeline via CLI	main_version2.py

## 🔁 Versioned Development Flow
Version	Role	Description
V1	Senior Dev	Abstract base class structure (Version1.py)
V2	Junior Dev	Implements logic over V1 skeleton (Version2.py)
V3	Senior Dev	Adds new abstract methods for extended features
V4	Junior Dev	Implements V3 methods for new features

## 🧰 Technologies & Concepts Used
🔹 Python OOP with Abstract Base Classes (abc)

🔹 Modular, readable, and scalable code structure

🔹 Command-Line Interface (CLI) via argparse

🔹 Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

🔹 YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for Object Detection

✨ Designed to be intuitive: users can run the full pipeline without reading internal code.
